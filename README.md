# Flight-Price-Prediction-using-R

General Background Information:

Flight price prediction is an important area of investigation and implementation in this era of dynamic pricing. The airlines use sophisticated algorithms that calculate ticket prices, taking into consideration a great number of factors: demand, competition, seasonality, and customer behavior. To the passengers, forecasting ticket prices helps them to plan and optimize their travel costs; in the case of airlines, it helps enhance revenue management and improve customer satisfaction. With the advancement of
machine learning, the clear and articulate analysis of historical data enables the construction of predictive models that forecast the prices of flight tickets.


Motivation: 

This project is motivated by the hustle tourists go through just to get fairly priced tickets
and the complications airlines have to endure in trying to judge the best price. Being frequent travelers, we understand the logistical headache and budgetary challenge caused by unexpectedly high ticket prices. This work aims to close this gap by applying machine learning to make flight pricing more candid and predictable. Besides, the work with advanced regression techniques in data analysis follows my aim to study the application of machine learning to more reality-based situations.


Problem Statement:

The aim of this project is to provide the opportunity of developing the models that can
predict flight ticket prices based on various parameters such as time of departure,
destination, duration, and class. This price forecasting capability should also be in a
position to make use of knowledge availability and help travellers in making intelligent
choices while ensuring the optimization of travel costs. These predictions will be of great
use in helping the airlines modify their pricing strategies accordingly.


Objectives:

Understand the factors that influence ticket prices.
Build models to predict ticket prices based on these factors.
Test and compare multiple models to find the most accurate one.
Provide actionable insights for travelers and businesses to improve decision- making.
